# Requirements Document - Neon Database Migration

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration from Supabase to Neon database for the draggable notes application. The migration aims to improve real-time performance, reliability, and resolve current sync issues while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Supabase to Neon database, so that I have better performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to Neon PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN notes are created, updated, or deleted THEN they SHALL be persisted in Neon database
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing note data SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN using Neon THEN the database connection SHALL be more stable than Supabase
5. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL have better performance than the current setup

### Requirement 2: Real-time Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time collaboration to work properly, so that I can see changes from other users immediately without refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user creates a note THEN it SHALL appear immediately in my view
2. WHEN another user moves a note THEN the position SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN another user edits note content THEN the changes SHALL sync instantly
4. WHEN another user deletes a note THEN it SHALL disappear from my view immediately
5. WHEN multiple users are online THEN the user count SHALL update accurately
6. WHEN real-time events occur THEN they SHALL not require page refresh

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my existing notes to remain intact after migration, so that I don't lose any data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration occurs THEN all existing notes SHALL be transferred
2. WHEN notes are migrated THEN all properties SHALL be preserved (id, content, position, color, timestamps)
3. WHEN the new database is active THEN note IDs SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN accessing migrated notes THEN they SHALL display correctly
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no data SHALL be lost

### Requirement 4: Improved Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want faster database operations, so that the app feels more responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating notes THEN they SHALL appear instantly (< 100ms)
2. WHEN updating note positions THEN changes SHALL sync quickly (< 200ms)
3. WHEN loading the app THEN notes SHALL load faster than current implementation
4. WHEN multiple operations occur THEN the database SHALL handle them efficiently
5. WHEN under load THEN performance SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 5: Real-time Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust real-time system, so that collaboration features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing real-time THEN it SHALL use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
2. WHEN connections drop THEN the system SHALL reconnect automatically
3. WHEN real-time events occur THEN they SHALL be delivered reliably
4. WHEN multiple users collaborate THEN conflicts SHALL be resolved properly
5. WHEN the system scales THEN real-time performance SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 6: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy database configuration, so that deployment and development are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN connection SHALL be configured via environment variables
2. WHEN deploying THEN the database connection SHALL work in production
3. WHEN developing locally THEN the database SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN they SHALL not require code changes
5. WHEN credentials are updated THEN the app SHALL connect successfully

### Requirement 7: Migration Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a safe migration process, so that I can rollback if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating THEN a backup of current data SHALL be created
2. WHEN issues occur THEN rollback to Supabase SHALL be possible
3. WHEN testing migration THEN it SHALL be done in a safe environment first
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN data integrity SHALL be verified
5. WHEN problems arise THEN they SHALL be detectable and recoverable

### Requirement 8: Code Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean database abstraction, so that future migrations are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing database layer THEN it SHALL be abstracted from UI components
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use consistent interfaces
3. WHEN adding new features THEN database integration SHALL be straightforward
4. WHEN changing databases THEN minimal code changes SHALL be required
5. WHEN maintaining code THEN database logic SHALL be well-organized
