## Features Deployed

Your collaborative Post-It Notes app is now live with:

- 🎨 **Interactive Notes**: Create, edit, and delete colorful sticky notes
- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop**: Move notes around the infinite canvas
- 🔍 **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate the canvas with mouse/touch gestures
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- 🎯 **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick actions for power users
- 🗺️ **Minimap**: Overview of all notes for easy navigation
- 💾 **Database Integration**: Notes persist using Neon PostgreSQL
- 🔄 **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket support for live updates

## Database Configuration

The app uses Neon PostgreSQL with the following environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your Neon database connection string
- Make sure this is configured in your Vercel project settings

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployment**: Visit your Vercel URL to ensure everything works
2. **Configure environment variables**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel
3. **Test real-time features**: The WebSocket server may need separate deployment for full collaboration
4. **Custom domain** (optional): Add a custom domain in Vercel settings

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check Vercel function logs for API errors
- Verify database connection in Vercel environment variables
- WebSocket features require a separate WebSocket server deployment

## Success! 🚀
