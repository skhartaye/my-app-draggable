# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Sticky Notes app to Netlify.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Neon Database** - Your database should already be set up
2. **GitHub Repository** - Push your code to GitHub
3. **Netlify Account** - Sign up at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare for Netlify

The app has been configured for Netlify deployment with:
- ✅ `netlify.toml` configuration file
- ✅ Netlify-specific version without WebSocket dependencies
- ✅ Build scripts optimized for static deployment

### 2. Environment Variables

In your Netlify dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string
```

### 3. Deploy Options

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Connect GitHub to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub and select your repository

2. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Node version: `18`

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon connection string

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app

#### Option B: Manual Deployment

1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:netlify
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir=.next
   ```

## 🎯 What's Different in the Netlify Version?

### ❌ **Removed Features:**
- Real-time collaboration (WebSocket server)
- Live cursors
- Multi-user presence indicators

### ✅ **Kept Features:**
- All note functionality (create, edit, delete, move)
- Database persistence with Neon
- Responsive design
- Touch/mobile support
- Zoom and pan
- Color picker
- Notes overview
- All UI components

## 🔄 Adding Real-time Back (Advanced)

If you want real-time features on Netlify, you have these options:

### Option 1: Use Pusher
```bash
npm install pusher pusher-js
```
Replace WebSocket client with Pusher integration.

### Option 2: Use Supabase Realtime
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```
Migrate from Neon to Supabase for built-in real-time.

### Option 3: Use Ably
```bash
npm install ably
```
Integrate Ably for real-time messaging.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Make sure all environment variables are set
- Check that your Neon database is accessible
- Verify Node.js version is 18+

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly formatted
- Test the connection string locally first
- Check Neon database permissions

### Missing Features
- The Netlify version doesn't include real-time features
- This is normal and expected for static deployment

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your app will be available at:
`https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

The app will work as a single-user sticky notes application with full database persistence!
